# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
1. This is still a big learning curve for me at this time.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
1. Both the For and Conditional statements are a big learning curve.  I don't mind researching and troubleshooting, but it took a lot more time to complete the assignments than I expected.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
1. **Everything** I will continue to practice lots of repetition.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
1. Honestly, at this point in the evening, after such a long day of new information, I just need time to process.
